# AB_Testing_Marketing_Campaign_Analysis

## A/B testing project to compare the performance of two marketing campaigns and identify which one delivered higher conversions with statistical confidence.

Here’s the approach I followed:

### Step 1: Dataset Preparation
I collected the data for both campaign versions and imported it into Python. After that, I cleaned the dataset and ensured all fields were in the correct format for analysis.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
I ran descriptive statistics to understand the overall data shape and checked for outliers or inconsistencies. I also visualized the click and conversion distributions to identify patterns.

### Step 3: Comparison of Key Metrics
I grouped the conversion data for both campaigns and calculated the difference in performance. To make insights clearer, I visualized the comparison using bar charts.

### Step 4: Behaviour and Relationship Check
Using scatter plots, I examined the relationship between clicks and conversions and checked whether increased engagement aligned with higher conversion rates.

### Step 5: Statistical Testing
I defined the hypothesis and ran statistical tests to determine whether the performance difference between the two campaigns was significant and not just random variation.

### Step 6: Insights and Recommendation
Finally, based on the statistical results and visual findings, I recommended the better-performing campaign and suggested areas for further optimization.
